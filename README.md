# Maze Solver With BFS and DFS Algorithm
2nd project for algorithm strategy course in ITB. In this project we are assigned to make a maze solver using breadth first search (BFS) and depth first search (DFS) algorithm implemented in c#. The maze is represented by a 2D array of char. The maze is solved by finding all  the treasure on the map. The start point is represented by K and the treasure is represented by T. The path is represented by R and the wall is represented by X. The program will output the path from the start point to all the treasure. The program will also output the number of nodes that are visited by the algorithm.
